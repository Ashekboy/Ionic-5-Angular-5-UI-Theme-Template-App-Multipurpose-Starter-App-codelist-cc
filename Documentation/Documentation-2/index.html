		<section id="why">

			<h4 id="using_starters_setting_up_the_header">WHY IONIC 5</h4>
			<p>
				ionic 5 introduces our brand new open source animations utility, Ionic Animations, that provides the
				tools developers
				need to build highly performant animations regardless of the framework they are using

			</p>
			<p>
				The largest change in this release of ionic 5 is a massive design upgrade across our UI components.
				Apple recently released iOS 13,
				which updated the design of many components and thus warranted some updates to our own. Let’s check out
				some of the
				changes we made to match native iOS!
			</p>
			<p>
				All of these changes are made in the core of Ionic Framework, which also applies to our Angular, React,
				and Vue (beta).
			</p>
			<p>
				You may be concerned about the upgrade process due to the fact that this is a major version release, but
				fret not! When
				we migrated to follow the semantic versioning convention, we committed ourselves to publish a major
				release when any
				known incompatible API changes were introduced. So in this case, the major version just indicates that
				our public API
				has been updated. And because we now use Web Components, API changes are handled separately between our
				UI components
				and the JavaScript framework.
			</p>

			<h4 id="using_starters_setting_up_the_header">WHY ANGULAR</h4>
			<p>
				Angular implements MVC architecture to develop web application. It provides a platform where only few
				attributes needs
				to be added to the HTML language and progress with the development will be faster. It enhances HTML
				which makes all
				difficult tasks move smoothly
			</p>
			<p>
				Angular makes it easy to arrange things like dynamic loading and dependencies and utilize them as
				required without
				worrying about instances and namespaces. Angular will take care of the complete life cycle of the
				objects thus handles
				dependencies in an exceptional way.
			</p>
			<p>
				Angular contains many ready made tools and components that would reduce the development time, also in
				each version
				release of angular it is made simpler and faster.
			</p>
			<p>Angular utilizes two-way data binding; the benefit of two-way data binding is that updates to the
				underlying data store
				happen automatically. When the data store updates, the UI updates as well. This allows you to remove a
				lot of logic from
				the front-end display code, particularly when making effective use of Angular’s declarative approach to
				UI presentation.
				In essence, it allows for true data encapsulation on the front-end, reducing the need to do complex and
				destructive
				manipulation of the DOM.</p>

			<p>
				After downloading the ionic 5 starter full app file from our website initappz, extract it
				and in the
				extracted folder
				locate the <em>starters.zip</em> file. You can then use this starter apps using ionic CLI</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Installing Ionic</strong>
					<br>
					<p>
						Ionic apps are created and developed primarily through the Ionic command-line utility. The Ionic
						CLI is the preferred
						method of installation, as it offers a wide range of dev tools and help options along the way.
						It is also the main tool
						through which to run the app and connect it to other services, such as Ionic Appflow.
					</p>
					<h4 id="getting_started_updating_starter">Install the Ionic CLI</h4>
					<p>Before proceeding, make sure your computer has

						<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" class="">
							Node.js</a>
						installed. See


						<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/" class="">
							these instructions</a>

						to set up an environment
						for Ionic.</p>
					<p>Install the Ionic CLI with npm:</p>
				</li>

			</ol>


			<div class="alert alert-info">
				$ npm install -g @ionic/cli
			</div>
			<p>
				If there was a previous installation of the Ionic CLI, it will need to be uninstalled due to a change in
				package name.
			</p>
			<div class="alert alert-info">
				$ npm uninstall -g ionic
			</div>
			<div class="alert alert-info">
				$ npm install -g @ionic/cli
			</div>

					<img src="assets/images/folder.png" alt="Folder Structure" />


					<p> <b>Open the Installations Guides.pdf File for Installations and Setup Instructions.</b></p>
					<p><i>Note If you wish to Use whole project instead of the Some Content of Project then you can
							Directly use it
							as
							Shown in

					<p> <b>When you unzip the App_code.zip then You will have the Project Source Code</b></p>
					<p>You will find the Folder name as App_code</p>
					<p> Now Open Terminal for Mac or Command Prompt for Windows and Open App_code Folder

						terminal.</p>
					<img src="assets/images/terminal.png" alt="terminal" />
					<p> Now Follow the Instructions in Installations Guides.pdf file for further Installations Steps.
					</p>

					<p> Now Open the App_code folder inside your Code Editor Like Visula Studio code ,sublime
						etc. you
						will
						see
						the structure of Ionic Projects</p>
					<img src="assets/images/code.png" alt="Project structure" />
					<p> Now Open the config.xml file and Change the Name and Other Stuff like app version and app

			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>REST APIs Configurations</strong>
					<p>CodeIgniter lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for
						a given task.
						Codeigniter Development is one of the best PHP framework in web Application Development. ... As
						compared to the other
						frameworks, Codeigniter Development is fast, reliable, its time and speed is significant.</p>
					<p>here we will use Codeigniter for our REST APIs, you can download it from here <a
							href="https://codeigniter.com/download">here</a>
					</p>
					<p>here i am using MAMP as my local server in my Macbook, you can use XAMP, LAMP, WAMP as your local
						server</p>
					<p>Now inside App_Source_Code zip you can find REST-APIs.zip. extract this file and you can see
						there is database.sql file will be there </p>
					<p>Next step is to copy that REST-APIs source code inside htdocs and import database.sql in your
						phpmyadmin section </p>
					<p>Create new database and give name as rest and import that database.sql file </p>
					<img src="assets/images/rest1.png" alt="">
					<p>After placing that REST-APIs source code inside htdocs and importing database.sql in your system
						we need to add credentials for Codeigniter </p>
					<p>For That open application/config/database.php and add your server credentials here. as you can
						see in image below </p>
					<img src="assets/images/rest2.png" alt="">
					<p>here username and password for your local server and database is for name of our database and
						host is address for running it locally </p>
					<p>To verify installation status of rest REST-APIs just open project in your browser </p>
					<img src="assets/images/rest3.png" alt="">
					<p>If you see image like above then your installation is successfully done. </p>
					<p>Here we have used IONIC Native HTTP client for APIs call so it will run only on your Mobile
						devices </p>
					<p>IONIC Native HTTP is better way to integrate your api for your project.</p>
					<p>If You facing issue with CORS then it's better to user IONIC Native HTTP</p>
					<p>here i am using POSTMAN for API testing </p>
					<p>You can find APIs DOCs <a
